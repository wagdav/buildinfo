buildinfo
=========

`buildinfo` is a Template Haskell library that allows to include build information (build time, version control information) in a Haskell program at compile.


Example
-------

The examples/ directory contains the short example that shows how to display the build information in your program.  Compile and run the example:

    $ cd examples
    $ ghc example.hs -i../
    $ ./example
